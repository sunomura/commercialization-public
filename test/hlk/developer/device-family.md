# Device Family


A **DeviceFamily** object is a collection of hardware IDs that are cached in the data store under a common name. **DeviceFamily** is useful for treating a large number of devices that have different hardware IDs as one device to test in parallel. For example, a video-card manufacturer might have 100 different video cards (with different hardware IDs) that all have essentially the same functionality.

>[!NOTE]
>  
Hardware IDs that are added to a **DeviceFamily** must match the hardware IDs that Windows® reports for a device.
