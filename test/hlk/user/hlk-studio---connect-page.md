# HLK Studio - Connect Page


The **Connect** option lets you view .hlkx files. This feature is useful if you need to share an .hlkx file with another person.

An .hlkx file is a compressed file format created by HLK Studio. An .hlkx file, also known as a submission package, is what you submit for certification. An .hlkx file must be digitally signed to be a valid submission package.

HLK Studio supports viewing .hlkx packages. For example, if you want to troubleshoot a test offline, you can open an existing .hlkx package using the **Connect** option. In this mode, you can view all details of the project, including pass/fail results and log files.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>  
You cannot open an .hlkx package created from a previous release of the HLK. The version of HLK Studio and the package you want to view must be the same.

 

1.  From HLK Studio, choose **Connect**.

2.  Select **Package** option, and then choose **Browse** to open an existing .hlkx package.
