These sets of tests validate cameras functionality with the MF and IMFCaptureEngine.

-   **Camera Driver Basic Tests - \***

    Tests against a subset of camera media types and shorter duration of tests than functional or reliability.

-   **Camera Driver Functional Tests - \***

    Tests against a larger set of media types and have longer duration of the test.

-   **Camera Driver Reliability Tests - \***

    Tests against a larger set of media types and have longer duration of the test, and more complex scenarios.

-   **\*- Image Stream - \***

    Validates that the system is able to take photo from MF\_CAPTURE\_ENGINE\_PREFERRED\_SOURCE\_STREAM\_FOR\_IMAGE.
