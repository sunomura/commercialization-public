This test uninstalls and reinstalls the drivers for selected devices and runs IO on devices, verifies that no device or driver, except the device under test, has been affected by devices, driver installations, or co-install processes, and verifies that no system resources have been overwritten during a device or driver package installation.

When the test runs the test case that no device or driver, except the device under test, has been affected by devices, driver installations, or co-install processes, it creates two files: preinstallscan.xml and postinstallscan.xml. The preinstallscan.xml file records information about every device before the test starts. After the test completes, it records information about every device in the postinstallscan.xml file. The two files are then examined for differences. You can view the preinstallscan.xml and postinstallscan.xml files by right clicking the **Run Test** task and then clicking **Additional Files** on the **Results** tab in HLK Studio for this test.

This test does the following:

1.  Verifies that the test device and its descendants are not reporting any device problem codes.
2.  Tests I/O on the test device and its descendants using WDTF Simple I/O plugins. See [Provided WDTF Simple I/O plug-ins](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh781398) for more information.
3.  Reinstalls the original driver on the test device using [IWDTFDriverSetupAction2::UpdateDriver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450945) method.
4.  Verifies that the test device and its descendants are not reporting any device problem codes.
5.  Tests I/O on the test device and its descendants using WDTF Simple I/O plugins. See [Provided WDTF Simple I/O plug-ins](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh781398) for more information.
6.  Reboots the system if step \#3 requires a reboot.
7.  Installs NULL driver on the test device using [IWDTFDriverSetupAction2::UnInstallDriverPermanently](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450941) method Reboots the system if a reboot is required.
8.  Reinstalls the original driver on device under test using [IWDTFDriverSetupAction2::UpdateDriver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450945) method.
9.  Verifies that the test device and its descendants are not reporting any device problem codes.
10. Tests I/O on the test device and its descendants using WDTF Simple I/O plugins. See [Provided WDTF Simple I/O plug-ins](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh781398) for more information.
11. Repeats step 1 - 10 several times.
