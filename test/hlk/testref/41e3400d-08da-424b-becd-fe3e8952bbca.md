Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Wireless LAN (802.11) Testing Prerequisites](wireless-lan--80211--testing-prerequisites.md).

This test allows the test scheduler (user) to run the WLAN Scan Tests with specific parameters. For each of the APs the user can specify the following via one of the CustomAP\[1|2\]Config\[24|5\]GHz:

-   SSID Broadcast Setting: Hidden or Visible
-   EAP Phase 1 Type: NONE or EAP\_PEAP or EAP\_TTLS
-   EAP Phase 2 Type: NONE or MSCHAPV2
-   Authentication Algorithm: OPEN or WEP or WPAPSK or WPA or WPA2PSK or WPA2
-   Cipher Algorithm: NONE or WEP or TKIP or AES
-   Channel: Integer Channel Number
-   Phy Type: A or B or G or N or AC

Below are the examples of AP Configs used by some of the tests:

-   Hidden.NONE.NONE.open.none.11.g
-   Visible.NONE.NONE.WPA2PSK.AES.44.n

This test performs the following actions:

-   If CustomAPConfig parameters are specified, configure two routers, that are named Router 0 and Router 1, as below. If parameters are not specified, the test does nothing.
    -   Router 0 – 2.4Ghz : Configured by user parameter Test\_CustomAP1Config24GHz
    -   Router 0 – 5Ghz : Configured by user parameter Test\_CustomAP1Config5GHz (Never used by test)
    -   Router 1 – 2.4Ghz : Configured by user parameter Test\_CustomAP2Config24GHz
    -   Router 1 – 5Ghz : Configured by user parameters Test\_CustomAP2Config5GHz
-   Execute the BasicAssociation() test steps below.
-   If Standby testing is enabled (bit 0x1 set in Test\_CustomAssociationTestOptions), execute the AssociationPowerManagementSleep() test steps below for Standby or AOAC Sleep
-   If Hibernate testing is enabled (bit 0x2 set in Test\_CustomAssociationTestOptions), execute the AssociationPowerManagementHibernate() test steps below for Hibernate

The BasicAssociation() test performs the following actions:

-   Create a TCP server on the access point (AP) controller server (listen port 7777)
-   Create a profile for Router 0 - 2.4 GHz having ConnectionMode configured as manual. If executing a FIPS mode test, the profile is configured for FIPS mode.
-   Initiate a WlanConnect using the profile.
-   Wait for up to 30 seconds for the connect to complete by using WLAN notifications.
-   Wait for IP address on the adapter
-   Connect to the TCP server on the AP controller server to confirm that full network connectivity is available.
-   Use the WLAN API GetConnectionAttributes to confirm that the association is correct and the connection is to Router 0 at 2.4 GHz.
-   Exchange TCP packets with the TCP Server on the AP controller server
-   Turn off Router 0 – 2.4 GHz
-   Delete the profile for the Router 0 – 2.4 GHz
-   Turn on Router 1 – 5 GHz (if adapter support 5 GHz) or Router 1 – 2.4 GHz (if adapter does not support 5 GHz)
-   Create a profile for appropriate Router 1 band having ConnectionMode configured as manual. If executing a FIPS mode test, the profile is configured for FIPS mode.
-   Initiate a WlanConnect using the profile.
-   Wait for up to 30 seconds for the connect to complete by using WLAN notifications.
-   Wait for IP address on the adapter
-   Connect to the TCP server on the AP controller server to confirm that full network connectivity is available.
-   Use the WLAN API GetConnectionAttributes to confirm that the association is correct and the connection is to appropriate router and band
-   Exchange TCP packets with the TCP Server on the AP controller server.
-   Delete the profile for the Router 1

The AssociationPowerManagementSleep() test first verifies that the adapter can start connected to an AP when it goes through a Standby/Connected Standby transition. Next it verifies that the adapter can switch from one AP to another after it goes through a Standby/Connected Standby transition. It performs the following actions:

-   For Sleep testing, check if system is Standby or AOAC capable. If not capable, the test fails.
-   Create a TCP server on the access point (AP) controller server (listen port 7777)
-   Turn off all routers except Router 0 – 2.4 GHz
-   Create a profile for Router 0 - 2.4 GHz having ConnectionMode configured as manual.
-   Initiate a WlanConnect using the profile.
-   Wait for upto 30 seconds for the connect to complete by using WLAN notifications.
-   Wait for IP address on the adapter
-   Connect to the TCP server on the AP controller server to confirm that full network connectivity is available.
-   Use the WLAN API GetConnectionAttributes to confirm that the association is correct and the connection is to Router 0 at 2.4 GHz.
-   Exchange TCP packets with the TCP Server on the AP controller server.
-   Depending on system either Standby or go to Connected Standby for 120 seconds
-   After wake up validate that adapter is still connected
-   Use the WLAN API GetConnectionAttributes to confirm that the association is correct and the connection is to Router 0 at 2.4 GHz.
-   Exchange TCP packets with the TCP Server on the AP controller server
-   Delete all WLAN profiles (this will disconnect the adapter)
-   The above steps have validated that the adapter can start connected to an AP when going through a Standby or Connected Standby transition. Next the test will verify transition from one AP to another.
-   Create a TCP server on the access point (AP) controller server (listen port 7777)
-   Turn off all routers except Router 0 – 2.4 GHz
-   Create a profile for Router 0 - 2.4 GHz having ConnectionMode configured as manual.
-   Initiate a WlanConnect using the profile.
-   Wait for upto 30 seconds for the connect to complete by using WLAN notifications.
-   Wait for IP address on the adapter
-   Connect to the TCP server on the AP controller server to confirm that full network connectivity is available.
-   Use the WLAN API GetConnectionAttributes to confirm that the association is correct and the connection is to Router 0 at 2.4 GHz.
-   Exchange TCP packets with the TCP Server on the AP controller server.
-   Configure the AP controller server machine to turn off the Router 0 at 2.4 GHz after 30 seconds and turn on Router 1 5GHz (if adapter supports 5GHz) or Router 1 2.4 GHz (if adapter does not support 5 GHz)
-   Depending on system either Standby or go to Connected Standby for 120 seconds
-   After wake up sleep for 30 seconds

-   Use the WLAN API GetConnectionAttributes to confirm that the association is correct and the connection is to Router 1 and appropriate band
-   Exchange TCP packets with the TCP Server on the AP controller server.
-   Delete all WLAN profiles (this will disconnect the adapter)
-   The above steps have validated that the adapter can switch from one AP to another after it goes through a Standby or Connected Standby transition.

The AssociationPowerManagementHibernate() test first verifies that the adapter can start connected to an AP when it goes through a Hibernate transition. Next it verifies that the adapter can switch from one AP to another after it goes through a Hibernate transition. It performs the following actions:

-   For Hibernate testing, check if system is Hibernate capable. If not capable, the test completes successfully.
-   Create a TCP server on the access point (AP) controller server (listen port 7777)
-   Turn off all routers except Router 1 – 5 GHz (if adapter supports 5 GHz) or Router 1 – 2.4 GHz (if adapter does not support 5 GHz)
