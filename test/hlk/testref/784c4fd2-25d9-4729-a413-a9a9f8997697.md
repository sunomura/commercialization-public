Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Mouse or other Pointing Device Testing Prerequisites](mouse-or-other-pointing-device-testing-prerequisites.md).

There are two iterations of this test, as follows.

1.  Iteration 1: Button presses with capacitive contacts

    1.  Following the instructions on the screen, put one finger on the center of the touchpad surface, and depress the physical button. Verify that the button state is down (the grey bar in the test should turn green), and that the button state returns to off when the pressure is removed.

    2.  Repeat the last step with 2, 3… *N* contacts, where *N* is the maximum number of contacts that are supported by the device.

        If the touchpad’s physical button is reported anytime it is depressed, and stops being reported as soon as it is released, manually pass the iteration.

2.  Iteration 2: Button presses with non-capacitive contacts

    1.  Place a non-capacitive contact on the center of the touchpad surface, and apply pressure to depress the physical button. Verify that the button state is down (the grey bar in **PTLogo** should turn green), and that the button state returns to off when the pressure is removed.

    2.  If the touchpad’s physical button is reported anytime it is depressed, and stops being reported as soon as it is released, manually pass the iteration.
