QueueTest will attempt to schedule all of the tests in the current or child objects. If there is a failure, the scheduling of tests is stopped immediately and the method returns. The function will leave some tests scheduled, and some that are incomplete. The list returned identifies the tests that were scheduled.

This is not supported when the project is connected to a package.
