# Hardware requirements and vendor information

This topic provides a list of the test equipment that is required for the touch-related tests in the Windows Hardware Lab Kit (HLK), and information about the vendors who stock the listed equipment.

Here's a list of all the required test equipment for completing the [Precision Touchpad Tests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/precision-touchpad-tests) in the HLK. The images, instructions and examples in the Precision Touchpad Tests are based on the original TRIEX tools, but you should be able to run all the tests successfully on TRIEX, Tactile Automation, and ITRI tools and hardware.

## Precision touch test tool (PT3)
